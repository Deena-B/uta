The goal: A list of RefSeq transcripts with 1) sequence descrepancies with
GRCh37, and 2) equivalence with Ensembl transcripts (ENSTs).

* Requirements
- use NCBI RefSeq alignemnts specifically (as opposed to those at UCSC, which use BLAT)
- include historical transcripts
- support transcripts that have significant exon structure anomalies
  between the transcript and gene records


* Design
The requirement to include historical transcripts (i.e., no longer
available at NCBI) means that we need persistent storage.  Relying on NCBI
Eutilities exclusively won't work.

The requirement to allow significant anomalies means that we can't use the
current Locus transcript schema.

So, that leaves:
- designing a new schema
- populating it with data from the Locus transcript database
- updating it with data from NCBI
- computing alignments for refagree status
- computing equivalent ENSTs

The current code requires postgresql and psycopg2, but porting to other
dbs should be easy. 


* Output
One row per RefSeq transcript, current or obsolete.

Columns:
gene -- HGNC gene name
maploc -- [strand][NCBI maploc], eg -3q21.3
ac -- RefSeq NM
coords -- overall transcript coords
status -- current or obsolete, computed as "most recent version with same AC base"
ref agree
  CDS indels -- exon:posI/D
  UTR indels -- exon:posI/D
  substitutions -- exon:posS
