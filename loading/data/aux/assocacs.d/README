This directory contains tables of transcript-protein accession pairs
determined or downloaded manually, often for historical transcripts.

These files are used primarily during loading; see the
merged.assocacs.gz rule in uta/loading/Makefile.

On 2016-10-24, several files were consolidated into 20161024.tsv.gz.
Prior versions of these files were removed from the repo but still
exist in historical commits.
